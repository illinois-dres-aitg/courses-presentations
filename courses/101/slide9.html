<dt>Accessibility:</dt>

      
<dd>Different from Accommodation.</dd>

      
<dd>Signifies the degree to which products and systems (the environment) can be used effectively by people with disabilities.</dd>

      
<dd>Designs and practices that ensure both "direct access" (i.e. unassisted) and "indirect access" meaning compatibility with a person's assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers).</dd>

      
<dd>Accessible Technology (AT) is technology that is designed for use by the greatest number of people, including people with disabilities, and doesn't require adaptation or modification to remove barriers to access or operation.</dd>

      
<dd>Conversely, the technology that presents barriers to users with disabilities is "inaccessible".</dd>

    
</dl>
<p>Consider the graphic now. It is the barrier (the fence) that has been removed. By this change, the environment is changed and regardless of height, all three people can see the game. Viewing of the game is permissible from this spot by anyone, including those with disabilities. This is a result of accessibility, it benefits everyone.</p>
<p>In order to benefit everyone, accessibility in technology must be achieved through designing, developing, purchasing, implementing, and supporting systems that provide an equivalent user experience to all users, regardless of disability or the way they access the technology. It must be a part of the complete process from beginning to end.</p>
<p>While it is important to understand that there will always be a need for accommodation and remediation in inaccessible systems (in both the physical and electronic world), concepts of accessibility and inclusive design reflect the social model of disability, in which systemic barriers are minimized for the good of all.</p>
