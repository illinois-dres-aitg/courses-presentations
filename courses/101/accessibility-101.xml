    <title>What is Disability?</title>
    <contents>

      <p>Disability is not a single phenomenon, and does not have a single definition. Different individuals experience disability in different ways that are informed by myriad personal, social, and cultural factors.</p>

      <p>People often identify disability in functional terms, such as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Visual disabilities (e.g., blindness, low vision, color blindness)</li>
        <li>Auditory disabilities (e.g., deafness, hard of hearing)</li>
        <li>Motor disabilities (e.g., paralysis, cerebral palsy, missing/damaged limbs)</li>
        <li>Cognitive disabilities (e.g., autism, Down Syndrome, traumatic brain injury (TBI), attention deficit disorder (ADD), dyslexia (difficulty reading), learning disabilities in general)</li>
        <li>Psychological disabilities (e.g., depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder.</li>
        <li>Seizure disabilities (e.g., epilepsy)</li>
        <li>Age-related loss of function (e.g., diminished sensory acuity, dexterity, stamina)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Even within a disability type, there is large diversity. For example, a person may identify as being blind, yet this does not always mean that they have 100% loss of vision. Again, unique, diverse, and not always visible.</p>

    <title>Medical and Social Models of Disability</title>
    <contents>
<p>Of many frameworks that attempt to provide perspective and clarity to disability issues, perhaps the two most prominent are the “medical” and “social” models of disability.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="images/medical-social-model.png" alt="Medical and social model"/></p>

<dl>
  <dt>Medical Model</dt>
  <dd>The medical model asserts that disability is primarily the result of an individual’s impairments. In this model, disability is seen as a shortcoming, linked to the individual that requires correction or accommodation. In order to participate in school, employment, and other social institutions, an individual must seek assistance.</dd>

  <dt>Social Model</dt>
  <dd>By contrast, the social model asserts that society creates barriers that disable people; that disability is the result of social systems and environments that fail to take into account the full range of human capability. In this model, it is the systems that must be reimagined and adapted so that they are accessible and useable to people across a spectrum of ability levels.</dd>

  <title>Accommodation vs. Accessibility</title>
  <contents>

    <p>It is important to note that not all disabilities are apparent, take for example cognitive disabilities like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia, or psychological disabilities such as mental health conditions. People all-too-frequently doubt the existence of non-apparent disabilities or play-down their effects, and it is counterproductive to consider disabilities this way.</p>

    <p>Instead of categorizing disabilities into “visible” vs “invisible” or “apparent” vs “non-apparent”, it is more useful to consider barriers that might exist in any given context.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center"><img src="images/equality-equity-liberation.jpg" alt="Children of different heights watching a baseball game from the outfield illustrating the concept of equality, equity, liberation" title="detailed description follows"/></p>

    <p>This graphic shows three versions of the same scene. There are three people trying to watch a baseball game from behind the outfield fence. One is tall enough to see over the fence without a riser, the other two are not. We will talk more about each of these in the following pages, yet let's state some facts first.</p>

    <p>The first frame labeled "<em>equality</em>", everyone has the same restrictions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The three individuals are of different heights.</li>
      <li>Each individual has an identical box (we will call them "accommodations") to stand on.</li>
      <li>There is a fence (we will call this "the barrier") in front of the three,</li>
      <li>This arrangement allows two of the three to see over the barrier.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The middle frame labeled "<em>equity</em>", each person has a different setup:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>We still have three individuals of different heights.</li>
      <li>The tallest has no accommodation, the next shortest has one accommodation, and the shortest has two accommodations.</li>
      <li>The barrier still exists.</li>
      <li>This arrangement allows all three to see over the barrier.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The final frame labeled "<em>liberation</em>", all restrictions are removed:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>We still have three individuals of different heights.</li>
      <li>The barrier has been removed.</li>
      <li>No accommodations are being used.</li>
      <li>This arrangement allows all three to see the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In this graphic, the left panel represents inaccessibility; the middle panel represents accommodation, and the right panel represents accessibility.</p>

  <title>Accommodation</title>
  <contents>

    <p style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; border: 3px solid #eee"><img src="images/equity.png"  alt="Children of different heights watching a baseball game from the outfield illustrating the concept of equity" title="detailed description follows"/></p>

<p>Accommodation means that some aspect of a system - for example a document or facility - has been adapted or modified to meet the needs of a specific individual or group.</p>

<p>Accommodations are patches or "temporary fixes", applied retroactively to overcome barriers in the environment or system.</p>

<p>Referring back to the graphic, by using what is available - the boxes - and reorganizing these, the system can be changed so all can view the game. An accommodation has been made - the system (the boxes) has been changed. The barrier still exists, therefore, if the accommodation is removed, there is once again the potential for inaccessibility.</p>

<p>In a classroom setting, an example of an accommodation may include an alternate version of a print document for a student who is visually impaired, such as an electronic text copy or audio file. An another example may include extra time or non-distractive environments for text taking for a student with a cognitive disability.</p>

  <title>Accessibility</title>
  <contents>

    <p style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; border: 3px solid #eee"><img src="images/liberation.png"  alt="Children of different heights watching a baseball game from the outfield illustrating the concept of liberation" title="detailed description follows"/></p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Accessibility:</dt>

      <dd>Different from Accommodation.</dd>

      <dd>Signifies the degree to which products and systems (the environment) can be used effectively by people with disabilities.</dd>

      <dd>Designs and practices that ensure both "direct access" (i.e. unassisted) and "indirect access" meaning compatibility with a person's assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers).</dd>

      <dd>Accessible Technology (AT) is technology that is designed for use by the greatest number of people, including people with disabilities, and doesn't require adaptation or modification to remove barriers to access or operation.</dd>

      <dd>Conversely, the technology that presents barriers to users with disabilities is "inaccessible".</dd>

    </dl>

    <p>Consider the graphic now. It is the barrier (the fence) that has been removed. By this change, the environment is changed and regardless of height, all three people can see the game. Viewing of the game is permissible from this spot by anyone, including those with disabilities. This is a result of accessibility, it benefits everyone.</p>

    <p>In order to benefit everyone, accessibility in technology must be achieved through designing, developing, purchasing, implementing, and supporting systems that provide an equivalent user experience to all users, regardless of disability or the way they access the technology. It must be a part of the complete process from beginning to end.</p>

    <p>While it is important to understand that there will always be a need for accommodation and remediation in inaccessible systems (in both the physical and electronic world), concepts of accessibility and inclusive design reflect the social model of disability, in which systemic barriers are minimized for the good of all.</p>

    <title>Disability Barrier: Color Contrast</title>
    <contents>

<p>Rachel R. Vasquez posted on the A11y Project website about Color Contrast:</p>

<blockquote>"On the web, color contrast is about finding colors that not only provide maximum contrast, but provide enough contrast between content and the background for anyone with low vision impairments and color deficiencies. This doesn’t mean you have to limit your colors to complementary colors as we just talked about - but the contrast should be kept in mind all the same. The text and non-decorative images need to be clearly legible for everyone regardless of whether they have moderately low vision or color deficiencies. We can check colors for contrast by using one of many contrast tools online."</blockquote>


<p>A contrast ratio of 3:1 is the minimum standard for text and vision. For those with visual impairments however, the contrast ratio standard is 4.5:1. Yet, what does this mean? If colors, and the shades of each color are assigned numbers, then you start putting those next to each other, then you start getting these ratios. The idea is that you have to have enough contrast variation between a background and foreground color so that readability is made simple.</p>

<p>The following chart shows examples of good contrasting colors. Where no text is in a space indicates a contrast ratio below the minimum standard of 3:1.</p>

    <title>Text Alternatives for Images</title>
    <contents>

      <p style="float: right; margin-left: 1em"><img src="images/white-block.png" alt="Solid white image"/></p>

      <p>There used to be this joke where you would get a picture of just a white box. The punchline varied, yet it was always something like, "a snowman in a blizzard" or simply something that was white on white. Of course, there were many other renditions of this - the yellow box that was a banana on the sun, and so forth.</p>

      <p>Although they were sad attempts at humor, they were great examples of using alternate text (also called text descriptions).If you look at the box to the right, it looks like an empty box. When I say, "it's a snowman in a blizzard," it is very likely that your brain created that scenario in your mind to where you might actually answer, oh, ok, I see that now.</p>

      <p>When Assistive Technology (AT) encounters a item that is not text, it looks in the code for alternative text (alt text). If alt text has not been used, the graphic appears blank to the user, just like the image above appears blank to you. If the alt text is there, the AT will read the description and the user will receive the conveying information just as a visual user does when they see the image.</p>

      <h2>Why is it important?</h2>

      <p>Alt text is important as a non-visual person will not be able to access the information of visual items. How do you know if a visual item is conveying information? If you remove the element does the document, presentation, etc. does it lose meaning? If so, then it conveys meaning. If not, it is most likely aesthetic and does not need alt-text (border images, watermarks, etc.)</p>

      <p>Alt text can be simple or complex depending on what the image is conveying. As well, the same image may convey different information depending on what context it is being used in. For example, a photo of a cloudy sky would convey a different meaning if used in an atmospheric science course than in an art class.</p>
