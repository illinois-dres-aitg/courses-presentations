<h2>Video Captions</h2>
<p>Captions for videos are need by the people who are deaf, but are very useful for people who are:</p>
<ul>
          
<li>Non-native speakers often can read the language of the video better than listening to the language.</li>
          
<li>Students listening to onlne lectures spend significantly less time listening when captions are available.</li>
          
<li>People in a noisy or quiet environments and cannot hear or listen to the audio.</li>
          
<li>When people hear new words or terms, or when speaker is difficult to understand due to accent or recording quality.</li>
          
<li>Key word searches on the caption text to find relavant portions of a video.</li>
        
</ul>
<h2>Keyboard Support</h2>
<p>Keyboard interaction is required for people who cannot use the mouse, due to blindness or physical disability, but are also useful for:</p>
<ul>
          
<li>Touch typists who prefer to use keyboard commands, rather than pointing and clicking with a mouse.</li>
          
<li>People who are traveling when using a mouse or track pad is difficult due to constraints in their seating positon and posture.</li>

      Everyday examples of Universal Design include curbs cuts in sidewalks, ramps into buildings, automatcially opening doors into buildings and wider doors and grab bars in bathrooms that benefit more than just people with mobility impairments.

      This slide highlights some of the benefits of universal design in the online world.

    Captions for videos are required for people who are deaf, but are very useful to everyone.

        For example non-native speakers of the language being spoken on the video is a common occurance in higher education where students are often encourages to take at least part of their studies in other counties and cultures.

        Another example is the redundancy captions provide to everyone to learn more efficently. In one controlled study on the availability of captions for the video lectures of an online math course, half the students recieved the videos with captions and half without caption.  The group receving the captioned videos spent on average spent 40% less time watching the videos, approximately 40 hours less time watching the videos during the course, without any change in the distribution of grades for the two groups.  For the growing number of part-time and non-traditional students the reduction in time is extremely valuable to them.  Which group would you want to be in?

        People are using computing devices almost everywhere, including when commuting on public transportation, in crowded rooms or when their significant other maybe sleeping.  When in enviroments when it is too noisy to hear the audio or audio would disturb others captions are invaluable way to make videos usable.

        Another benefit is when an unfamiar or new word is spoken, or the speaker has an difficult to understand due to an accent or poor sound quality.  The listener can see the spelling of the word to help them remember and understanding the new terms or identify words or phrases that were hard to understand.

        Captions allow people and automated search engines to perform key word searches on the caption text to find relavant portions of the video for viewing.

    Keyboard interaction is required for people who cannot use the mouse, due to blindness or physical disability, but are also useful for eveyone in some situations.

        People who prefer touch typing can control the computer without having to take their hands of the keyboard to use a mouse or other pointing device.

        When people who are commuting or traveling by air they may not have the room or posture to use a pointing device.

    In the information age Universal Design helps makes our online world adapt to the needs of people and the situations they often find themselves, rather than forcing people to adapt to the constraints a particular resources has in terms of the types of interaction in supports and information it can provide.
