      The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was the first legislation in the United States that required the services of the federal government and public education to be accessible to people with disabilities.

      The act established that access to public services and information is considered a civil right, not just something nice to do.

      One of the basic premises of the act is that people with disabilities should have access to information at the same time and in their preferred format as everyone else.

      While the web did not exist in 1973, the same principles of access to information available on websites is covered.

      The act applies to the federal government and entities that receive federal funds, including educational institutions, state and local governments.

      In 1990 the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law to extended the civil rights more generally to employment, public transportation, businesses like stores and restaurants, and telecommunication systems.

      The ADA does not make any specific reference or requirements for the web, since the web was barely invented at the time of the signing, so there is some legal ambiguity if the ADA applies to the websites of private companies.

      In 2000 the Federal Section 508 requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 were amended to include specific requirements for software and web accessibility.

      The Section 508 requirements were based on the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.

      In 2017 Section 508 was amended to update the web accessibility requirements to use the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 Level A and AA requirements, which we will talk about more in a later slide.

      The use of the Section 508 standard is often cited as the standard in civil right discrimination cases based on Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the ADA.

      Even for private companies where the the ADA law is ambiguous, most companies voluntarily comply when they learn there are barriers to people with disabilities.
