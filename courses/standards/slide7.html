      It is often difficult for people without a disability to understand or empathize with the functional barriers faced by people with disabilities in the environments our societies have created.

      Often simple changes in the environment enable participation and inclusion.

      This slide shows the general principles of universal design conplied by North Carolina State University in 1997.


The first principle is Equitable use.
    The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.
    An example of the first principle are websites designed so they are accessible to everyone, including people who are blind and using text-to-speech software.

The second principle is Flexibility in use.
    The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.
    An example of the second principle is when visiting a museum the museum provides media that allows people to choose to read or listen to a description of the contents of display cases.

The third principle is Simple and intuitive use.
    Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.
    An example of the third principle is illustrated by controls on consumer electronics that are labeled with both text and symbols that are simple and intuitive to understand.

The fourth principle is Perceptible information.
    The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.
    An example of the fifth principle are videos that include captions.

The fifth principle is Tolerance for error.
    The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.
    An example of the fifth principle is a software program that provides guidance and background information when people make an inappropriate or invalid response.

The sixth princple is Low physical effort.
    The design can be used efficiently, comfortably, and with a minimum of fatigue.
    An example of the sixth principle is doors to a building that open automatically for people with a wide variety of physical characteristics.

The seventh and last princple is Size and space for approach and use.
    Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of the user's body size, posture, or mobility.
    An example of the seventh principle is a flexible work area that has adequate workspace for people who are left- or right-handed and for those who need to work from a standing or seated position.
