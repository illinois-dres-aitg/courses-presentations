      It is often difficult for people without a disability to understand or empathize with the functional barriers faced by people with disabilities in the environments our societies have created.

      Often simple changes in the environment enable participation and inclusion.

      This slide shows the general principles of universal design conplied by North Carolina State University in 1997.


Equitable use.
    The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.
    Example: A professor's website is designed so that it is accessible to everyone, including students who are blind and using text-to-speech software.

Flexibility in use.
    The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.
    Example: A museum, visited as a field trip for a course, allows each student to choose to read or listen to a description of the contents of display cases.

Simple and intuitive use.
    Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.
    Example: Control buttons on science equipment are labeled with text and symbols that are simple and intuitive to understand.

Perceptible information.
    The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.
    Example: A video presentation projected in a course includes captions.

Tolerance for error.
    The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.
    Example: Educational software provides guidance and background information when the student makes an inappropriate response.

Low physical effort.
    The design can be used efficiently, comfortably, and with a minimum of fatigue.
    Example: Doors to a lecture hall open automatically for people with a wide variety of physical characteristics.

Size and space for approach and use.
    Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of the user's body size, posture, or mobility.
    Example: A flexible science lab work area has adequate workspace for students who are left- or right-handed and for those who need to work from a standing or seated position.
