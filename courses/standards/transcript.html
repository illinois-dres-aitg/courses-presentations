                        Goals for Web Standards and Accessibility</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
      Hello, my Name is Jon Gunderson.

I have been helping the University of Illinois for over 25 years to understand how to make information technologies more accessible to people with disabilities.

I have been participating in the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative for over 20 years to help develop standards for making online resources more accessible to people with disabilities.

I am currently a member the Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA) and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) working groups of the W3C.

My goal in teaching this badging course is help you understand more about how web technologies can be designed to be more accessible to people with disabilities and to give you insights on how people with disabilities experience the web.

I welcome you to the web standards and accessibility module of our badging courses to help you better understand the importance of W3C standards in making the web more accessible.


This slide outlines the major goals of the web standards and accessibility video.

This video should help you learn about and understand.

The original purpose of the web.

The prevalence and types of disabilities as we age.

Introduce the concept of Universal Design for the web.

Universal Design principles improve the usability of the web for everyone, including people with disabilities.

Why the use of web standards is important for creating accessible web content.

And which W3C standards are the most important for web accessibility.

NOTE: All of the HTML slides used in this video are publicly available for you to view and share.

                        Slide 2:
                        Why was the World Wide Web Invented?</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
This slide is about why the world wide web was developed in the first place.
While it is hard to image a world without the web today, it is still a relatively new technology, created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989as aresearch project at the CERN particleaccelerator lab in Switzerland.
Tim was observing a problem research teams were having collaborating on writing reports and papers, and in general sharing research protocols and results.
Scientists would send each other documents via e-mail and when they tried to open them discovered they did not have the application needed to view and edit the document.
This was because they were using different word processors, some used WordStar, others used Word Perfect, others used Microsoft Word or some other application.
These programs did not recognize the document format pf other word processors and the researchers were  stuck having to spend time reformatting or retyping content.
Tim had the idea that people should be able to create sharable documents and that everyone should be able to view and that other team members could share in editing.
Another important feature of the web is including theconcept of hypertext, the ability of documents to reference other document through links, so people can easily navigate and view related or supporting information.

                        Slide 3:
                        Purpose of the World Wide Web</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
Tim&rsquo;s idea of sharing information became the basis of the web and early browsers were also content editors so people could collaborate on writing, sharing and linking to web documents.

While the web has changed a lot since 1989 when Tim first demonstrated the potential of the web, the core principles remain the same, to provide a common platform for everyone to be able to view, create, edit and link to information on the web, including people with disabilities.

Tim also made the technologies he used to create the web open standards for everyone to be able to contribute to and to benefit from, and eliminate the barriers to participation associated with licensing fees and royalties.

Open standards mean people do not have to pay to use the technologies and anyone can use them to create new products and services.

The online courses in accessibility from Illinois are designed to help people understand how they can make sure people with disabilities gain the same benefits from web as everyone else.

                        Slide 4:
                        Web Usage Statistics</a>
</h2>
<div class="full-transcript">
The table on this slide shows the extent of how important the web and internet has become to people from around the world.  The table provides data on Internet usage by geographic region for June 2019.

The table has five columns and nine rows.

The first column identifies geographical regions of the world including rows in the table for.

Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America/Caribbean, Middle East, North America, Oceania/Australia and world total.

The second column is the number of people from a region who use the Internet.

and note on the last row, the world total is over four billion people using the Internet.

The third column is the percentage of the population for each region using the internet.

The highest percentages of people using the Internet are in North America and Europe at over 86%.

and the lowest is Africa, but even in Africa the percent usage is almost 40%.

The fourth column is the expected annual growth in use of the Internet for that region.

Over 11,000 percent for Africa.

Over 1,800 percent for Asia.

Almost 2,400 percent for Latin America.

Over 5,000 percent for the Middle East.

and the data clearly shows that developing countries are increasing their rate of usage at a rapid pace,

And will soon be near the saturation rates of western countries.

The fifth column is the percentage of all Internet usage by that region and it is interesting to note that almost half of world Internet usage is in Asia, with western countries only representing about 25% of world usage.

The data in the table show that Tim&rsquo;s vision of creating a web for everyone is being fulfilled with over 4 billion people using the Internet, representing 57% of the planet&rsquo;s population.
