This slide is about why the world wide web was developed in the first place.

While it is hard to image a world without the web today, it is still a relatively new technology, created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 as a research project at the CERN particle accelerator lab in Switzerland.

Tim was observing a problem researchers were having collaborating on research.

Scientists would send each other documents via e-mail and when they tried to open them, they
discovered they did not have the application needed to view and edit the document.

This was due to the use of different word processors, some used WordStar, others used Word Perfect, others used Microsoft Word or some other application.

These programs did not recognize the document formats of other word processors and the researchers were stuck spending time reformatting or retyping content.

Researchers were also having a hard time organizing, storing and retreiving the vast number of documents that were being created at CERN.

Tim had the idea that people should be able to create sharable documents that research teams could easily view and edit, and that the documents could be shared with other researchers and research teams.

Another important feature Tim included in the web is the concept of hypertext.

Hypertext provides the ability of documents to reference other documents through links, so people can navigate and view related or supporting information.

Hypertext alleviates many of the problems of finding and retrieving archived documents by including links to them when they are referenced in other documents.
