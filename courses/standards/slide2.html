<li>Tim Berners-Lee was a scientist at CERN particle accelerator lab in 1989.</li>
        
<li>Scientists were having problems sharing and collaborating on documents and research results, for example some of the word processing tools available in the late 1980's:
          <ul>
            
<li>WordStar</li>
            
<li>WordPerfect</li>

<li>Apple Write</li>
            
<li>LaTex</li>
          
</ul>

<li>Tim had an idea to not only share information between people, but with everyone.</li>
        
<li>Documents could reference each other through hyertext linking.</li>

This slide is about why the world wide web was developed in the first place.
While it is hard to image a world without the web today, it is still a relatively new technology, created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989as aresearch project at the CERN particleaccelerator lab in Switzerland.
Tim was observing a problem research teams were having collaborating on writing reports and papers, and in general sharing research protocols and results.
Scientists would send each other documents via e-mail and when they tried to open them discovered they did not have the application needed to view and edit the document.
This was because they were using different word processors, some used WordStar, others used Word Perfect, others used Microsoft Word or some other application.
These programs did not recognize the document format pf other word processors and the researchers were  stuck having to spend time reformatting or retyping content.
Tim had the idea that people should be able to create sharable documents and that everyone should be able to view and that other team members could share in editing.
Another important feature of the web is including theconcept of hypertext, the ability of documents to reference other document through links, so people can easily navigate and view related or supporting information.
