In summary this video has provided information on:

That the heart of the web is interoperability and open standards, making information available to everyone and this is becoming more of a reality for people with disabilities with the emergence of HTML5 and ARIA web standards for accessibility.

More people must understand accessibility, so I applaud the people taking these courses to learn more about how to create accessible online resources using web standards.

Web design and development platforms need to include accessibility as part of their templates, user interface libraries and quality assurance testing systems to help educate and support developers in creating content that is not only considered accessible, but also usable by people with disabilities.

In my mind the number one issue we have is authoring tools not supporting accessibility.  Accessibility must be integrated into web authoring environments, like the WYSIWYG editor used on content management systems like WordPress and Drupal.  Right now we have what I call accessibility by exception, people have to know about accessibility, the needs of people with disabilities, the accessibility features of the technology they are using, and how to get their authoring tool to include the accessibility features in the content they are creating.  These are four pretty big steps for most people and each step leaves more and more people out of creating accessible content.

What we need is accessibility by default, where the tool makes it easier to create accessible content and harder to create inaccessible content, by providing prompts and guidance to the author as they are editing a document or page.
